These are adapted Symboic JPF benchmarks. Their original versions can be found here:
    repo: https://babelfish.arc.nasa.gov/hg/jpf/jpf-symbc
    branch: updated-spf
    root directory: src/tests/gov/nasa/jpf/symbc
The benchmark was taken from the repo: 24 January 2018
Note: Only benchmarks usable in SV-COMP were taken.
Note: The changes we made are mostly conversion to SV-COMP format. Few however
      were extended so that they comprise a non-deterministic behaviour based
      on inputs to the main function.
