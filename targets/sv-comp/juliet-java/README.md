All benchmarks in this folder are derivations from the Juliet V1.3 Java Benchmark
created by the NIST and published at: https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/testsuite.php

As the main Benchmarks aims for security vulnerabilities not expressed
as reachability properties checkable by assert statements, it is not
possible to add the complete benchmark as is. The examples in this
folder have been selected by hand. Assert statements have been injected
at places related to the original security property.
