| [SpringDataTransformer.java](https://github.com/knife-fuzzer/blob/main/concolic-engine/src/main/java/de/uzl/its/swat/instrument/dataendpoint/SpringDataTransformer.java)     | The SpringDataTransformer class is a Java agent that implements the ClassFileTransformer interface. It is responsible for transforming class files before they are defined by the JVM. The transform method takes in a class file buffer and applies transformations to it using the ASM library. The modified class file is then returned or saved to disk, depending on the configuration. If an exception occurs during the transformation process, an error message is printed and the program is terminated. |

It does this by overriding the visitField and visitMethod methods of the ClassVisitor class.

| [SpringEndpointClassAdapter.java](https://github.com/knife-fuzzer/blob/main/concolic-engine/src/main/java/de/uzl/its/swat/instrument/springendpoint/SpringEndpointClassAdapter.java)     | The SpringEndpointClassAdapter is a visitor that instruments the parameters of all endpoint methods in a Java class, making them symbolic. It extends the ClassVisitor and overrides the visitMethod method to add a custom EndpointMappingMethodAdapter to the method visitor, which performs the instrumentation.                                                    |
| [SpringEndpointTransformer.java](https://github.com/knife-fuzzer/blob/main/concolic-engine/src/main/java/de/uzl/its/swat/instrument/springendpoint/SpringEndpointTransformer.java)       | The code represents a class file transformer used as an agent in a JVM. It intercepts the loading and transformation of class files and modifies specific classes based on certain criteria. The transformed classes are then returned as bytecode to be used by the JVM. Additionally, the code allows for logging and saving the instrumented classes if configured. |
| [EndpointMappingMethodAdapter.java](https://github.com/knife-fuzzer/blob/main/concolic-engine/src/main/java/de/uzl/its/swat/instrument/springendpoint/EndpointMappingMethodAdapter.java) | The code is a visitor that analyzes Java methods in Spring RestEndpoints. It makes primitive data types symbolic and marks Class objects for later instrumenting. It checks if a method is a REST endpoint by visiting annotations.

| [CharacterInvocation.java](https://github.com/knife-fuzzer/blob/main/concolic-engine/src/main/java/de/uzl/its/swat/invoke/CharacterInvocation.java) | The code is a CharacterInvocation class that provides a method for invoking a given method by name. The invokeMethod method takes the method name, arguments, method description, and a SymbolicStateHandler object. It uses a switch statement to determine which method to invoke and delegates the invocation to the corresponding private method. The invokeValueOf method checks if there is only one argument, extracts a CharValue from it, and creates a new CharacterObjectValue with the extracted value. Otherwise, it returns a PlaceHolder instance. |
| [StaticInvocation.java](https://github.com/knife-fuzzer/blob/main/concolic-engine/src/main/java/de/uzl/its/swat/invoke/StaticInvocation.java)       | The code is a collection of static methods for handling different method invocations. It checks the owner and name of the invoked method and delegates to specific handler methods accordingly, or returns a default placeholder value if no matching handler is found. It supports method invocations for classes like Main, String, Character, Integer, Long, and Math.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [StringInvocation.java](https://github.com/knife-fuzzer/blob/main/concolic-engine/src/main/java/de/uzl/its/swat/invoke/StringInvocation.java)       | This code defines a StringInvocation class with a single static method, invokeMethod, which handles method invocations for Java's String class. The method switches on the invoked method name and delegates to specific helper methods based on the method signature. The invokeValueOf method handles the valueOf method overloadings for converting various types to strings.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [InternalInvocation.java](https://github.com/knife-fuzzer/blob/main/concolic-engine/src/main/java/de/uzl/its/swat/invoke/InternalInvocation.java)   | The code provides a method that performs symbolic execution and checks for potential security vulnerabilities. It can make values symbolic, track them, and identify free variables in method parameters and fields. The code also logs the results of the analysis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [DynamicInvocation.java](https://github.com/knife-fuzzer/blob/main/concolic-engine/src/main/java/de/uzl/its/swat/invoke/DynamicInvocation.java)     | The code provides a method called "invokeMethod" that handles dynamic invocation of methods. It checks if the target method is "StringConcatFactory.makeConcatWithConstants" and concatenates strings accordingly, using the given arguments. If the target method is not implemented, it returns a placeholder value. The method also includes debug output statements.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
